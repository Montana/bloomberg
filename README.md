# Bloomberg
Bloomberg is a Ruby script I wrote in about an hour to fetch a company list from Bloomberg LP, using OAuth. 

<div style="text-align:center"><img src ="https://github.com/Montana/flowcharts/blob/master/download.png" /></div>


Just download the file and give it proper permissions.

<pre>cd bloomberg
chmod 777 bloomberg.rb</pre> 

Or require the gem, as specified in the gemspec I've attached with this file if you're trying to implemenet this in your program/app or whatever you're making.

This can be a nice backend for somebody looking for a quick CSV that is seeking companies that Bloomberg LP has listed. I used OAuth.
