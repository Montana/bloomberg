# Bloomberg
Bloomberg is a Ruby script to fetch a company list from Bloomberg LP, using OAuth. Just download the file, chmod it, do the following

<pre>cd bloomberg
chmod 777 bloomberg.rb</pre> 

Or require the gem, as specified in the gemspec I've attached with this file if you're trying to implemenet this in your program/app or whatever you're making.

This can be a nice backend for somebody looking for a quick CSV that is seeking companies that Bloomberg LP has listed. I used OAuth.
